# Phase-1-project
Aviation Risk Analysis: Data-Driven Aircraft Recommendation
# Aviation Risk Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes 60+ years of aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board to help a company entering the aviation industry identify the lowest-risk aircraft for private and commercial operations.

## 💼 Business Understanding
As our company explores expanding into the aviation industry, safety and risk management are critical to choosing which aircraft to purchase. The main stakeholder is the Head of the Aviation Division, who needs to understand:
- Which aircraft have the lowest incident severity?
- Does aircraft age affect risk?
- Which models are suitable for private vs commercial use?

## 📊 Data Understanding and Analysis
- **Source:** [National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)](https://www.ntsb.gov/)
- **Years Covered:** 1962–2023
- **Scope:** Civil aviation accidents in the U.S. and international waters

### Visualizations
#### 1. Top 10 Lowest-Risk Aircraft Models

## ✅ Conclusion
Our final recommendations are:

1. **Purchase low-risk models** like Cessna 172 and Piper PA-28 for private aviation.
2. **Avoid aircraft older than 20 years** due to increasing severity.
3. **Choose modern commercial jets** like Boeing 737 Next Gen and Airbus A320 for business use.

These insights support a low-risk, data-informed entry into the aviation market.
